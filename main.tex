\section{Introduction}

Context: FPGAs are used widely. Performance is key.
Broader applications (datacenters).

Most used hing is HLS to generate circuits. Most of them static schedules.
Everything is fixed at synthesis-time.

HLS is static. Static means we can't fully exploit parallelism.
Some dynamic information should help.

Parallel with VLIW and superscalar. Solution derives from VLIW tecniques? [28,37].
VLIW, and HLS is really successful for regular programs.

Result is new tradeoff between performance and circuit complexity.
We also want minimal programmer effort.
