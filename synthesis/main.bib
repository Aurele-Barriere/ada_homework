  abstract = {We present Pegasus, a compact and expressive
     intermediate representation for imperative languages. The
     representation is suitable for target architectures supporting
     predicated execution and aggressive speculation. In Pegasus
     information about the global dataflow of the program is encoded
     in local structures, enabling compact and efficient algorithms
     for program optimizations. As a proof of the versatility of
     Pegasus, we have used it in a compiler translating C programs to
     hardware implementations.},
